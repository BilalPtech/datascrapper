But like all underdogs \u2013 there\u2019s way more to it than it\u2019s given credit for.  This big (Brutalist) slab of concrete (surrounded by acres of countryside) has seen a lot of changes in recent years. In East Croydon, there are more entertainment options thanks to the arrival of Boxpark and the refurbishment of Fairfield Halls. There are increased education opportunities courtesy of a new London South Bank University campus and a partnership between Croydon College and the University of Roehampton. There are more enterprise possibilities due to a start-up culture fostered by the likes of Sussex Innovation Centre and Start Up Croydon. The restaurant and bar scene (celebrated at the annual Croydon Food Festival) is attracting foodies from across London and the long-awaited \u201cWestfield\u201d project is now underway again. All this in addition to what already made Croydon a great place to be: a thriving creative arts scene (showcased by it\u2019s London Borough of Culture 2023 programme), a vibrant community (based across a network of unique neighbourhoods \u2013 from Coulsdon, Purley and Sanderstead in the south to Norbury, Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood in the north) and excellent transport connections (including trains that get you to Central London in 14 mins, Gatwick Airport in 15 mins and Brighton in 45 mins). As a Borough, Croydon has always bred talent \u2013 nurturing top international stars on football fields at CPFC and in studios at The Brit School. Well known for being the birthplace of Dubstep, Croydon\u2019s wider music credentials are unrivalled. The Borough boasts a roll-call of iconic artists spanning all genres \u2013 from Samuel Coleridge Taylor, Captain Sensible and Desmond Dekker to Skream & Benga, Stormzy and Raye. A new wave of Creatives (supported and celebrated through the Borough\u2019s Creative Enterprise Zone) have made Croydon home \u2013 drawn to studios and workspaces like Matthews Yard, Turf, Conditions, Stanley Arts, ASC and Pirate. Croydon now has a record number of new developments and a growing population of workers, students and residents \u2013 who are attracted to all the other great things about the area. After a global pandemic, supporting local and investing in community has never been more important.
