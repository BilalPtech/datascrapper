                "East Croydon Cool talks\u2026is a blog series that explores topics of cultural interest via local area experts. This month we caught up with Cherilyn Yeates, the Project Manager atGig Buddies Croydon.",
                "Gig Buddies matches adults with learning disabilities to volunteers who have similar interests to go to events, gigs & activities together. Gig Buddies aims to ensure that people with learning disabilities don\u2019t miss out on a social life. The project helps to combat social isolation faced by many people with learning disabilities, by enabling people to make friends who have a similar interest to them.",
                "Gig Buddies Croydon is run by local charity Club Soda and is currently the only organisation in London running Gig Buddies. The Croydon project has attracted around 30 volunteers and buddies but they\u2019re looking for more! We caught up with Chez to find out more about what\u2019s involved.",
                "When did Gig Buddies start?Gig Buddies was started in 2013 by Sussex charity, Stay Up Late. The charity was founded to fight for the rights of people with learning disabilities to \u2018stay up late\u2019, have access to gigs and events in their community and not be restricted by support worker shifts when out socialising. Gig Buddies was a practical solution to the inflexible support that many people with learning disabilities face; by matching someone with a volunteer who has similar interests so they could stay out as late as they want and have more freedom, choice and independence. Stay Up Late eventually grew the project by creating a franchise, boxing up the Gig Buddies project and trialing it in different areas of the country (even Sydney Australia!)",
                "How long has it been operating in Croydon?After a pilot year in 2017, Gig Buddies Croydon officially launched in April 2018 and we have just celebrated our first year anniversary!",
                "How does it work?Volunteers and Gig Buddies come find us online or through word of mouth. Volunteers are interviewed, DBS checked and complete volunteer training. Both Volunteers and Gig Buddies attend our social events to meet new people and get to know the community we have built. We will also host smaller socials with potential pairings to see how people get on. We take our time to match people on their shared interests or personalities that vibe well. It\u2019s a careful process and we always make sure the pair have met a few times to ensure they are both comfortable and to create long lasting friendships.",
                "What events have you done in Croydon?Pre-covid \u2013 at least once a month, we host a social at a local cultural venue for everyone to meet up, chat, get to know each other and have fun. Venues we have been to include The Oval Tavern, The Ludoquist Cafe, FunHouse, Stanley Halls, Limitless VR and loads of other cool places.",
                "Do Gig Buddies groups from around the country ever get together?We have partner days once a year where all of the projects come together to discuss what they have been doing, share stories, brainstorm and work through any issues. During lockdown we collaborated on a 12 hour online festival where all the projects had a slot to play music, sing, dance or whatever! Minus a few technical hiccups, it was pretty radical!",
                "How did you manage during lockdown?It\u2019s been tough for us, as it has for everyone. Our whole project is based around exploring local nightlife, making connections and having an active social life \u2013 so it was hard to see how we could stay connected in a lockdown and keep our community engaged. We started by creating a weekly newsletter to share activities people could do online and keep a conversation going with our Gig Buddies. We then began to run online social events, one bigger event every 3 weeks and a coffee morning catch up on Zoom every 2 weeks. We have been able to build a dedicated group of people who attend and the attendance actually seems to be increasing as time goes on.",
                "It seems like friendships within the wider community have grown stronger through the Zoom events, and we\u2019ve seen some Gig Buddies becoming much more confident. It\u2019s been crucial for us as a team as well, to keep connected with people and have some fun in these strange times. Our online events have included online discos, a pub quiz, dress up guess who game, arts and crafts in collaboration with Collage Club London, karaoke nights and more wild nights! We have been able to start matching new pairs virtually as well, and have matched 2 new pairs of buddies, which is really exciting as we didn\u2019t think this was going to be possible.",
                "What do you look for in a volunteer?Firstly we look for someone who is Croydon based or in the surrounding boroughs and is over 18. You don\u2019t need any particular experience to be a Gig Buddy Volunteer, but we look for people that:",
                "are kind, patient and friendly with a sense of humour",
                "are willing to get to know somebody well",
                "love meeting new people",
                "care about social inclusion",
                "are proactive and reliable",
                "love to have fun!",
                "What has the feedback been from buddies?I think the best way to answer this, is for you to hear it straight from them! Over lockdown we asked some of our buddies to record themselves talking about their matches, what they get up to and the importance of their friendship. You can watch all the videosHERE.",
                "What is the future of Gig Buddies?We have funding secured until 2022 so until then we will be continuing to match new pairs of buddies, host fun socials and connect people with and without learning disabilities in Croydon to create a more diverse and inclusive local nightlife. We will be applying for funding to continue after that time! For now, we are taking it day by day in terms of the lockdown and continuing to deliver online events to keep our buddies engaged and continue to grow the strength of our community.",
                "How does and interested Gig Buddy or Volunteer get in touch with you?If you or someone you know has a learning disability and is based in Croydon, want to meet new people, grow your confidence and independence OR if you are interested in volunteering with Gig Buddies Croydon, are excited by the idea of making a new friend and supporting them to be able to access new opportunities\u2026you can get in touch with us by emailingcherilyn@gigbuddiescroydon.co.ukor find out more atwww.gigbuddiescroydon.co.uk"

                "East Croydon Cool talks\u2026is a blog series that explores topics of cultural interest via local area experts. With social distancing set to be part of our new normal, the search for alternative travel solutions has resulted in a huge increase in sales for both electric and manual bikes. So this month, we chatted with the founder ofEnergise E-Bikes(a pioneer in electric bike retail who now offers the largest range of e-bikes in the country) and who started the business right here in Croydon!",
                "The moment founder, Ray Wookey, tried an electric bike for the first time, he realised just how transformative this new technology could be. Being able to set off from home and complete a journey in comfort without having to worry about traffic jams, train cancellations or parking problems was a revelation; not to mention enormous fun!",
                "He could see that commuters who had seen train ticket prices rise and rise over the years could use e-bikes to get to work cheaply and quickly. People who had long given up cycling could start riding again with confidence, knowing that the e-bike would help them throughout the ride. Leisure riders, tired of the same old cycle routes could expand their horizons and go further and do more.",
                "Ray was so inspired by the e-bikes that together with a business partner, he began selling electric bikes in 2012 via a small retail outlet in Coulsdon called Cycling Made Easy. The interest in electric bikes grew so much that the store soon had to expand; moving to a 2000 square foot, purpose-built showroom which happened to be on the London to Paris cycle route; a route that a team from Cycling Made Easy have completed using e-bikes!",
                "In 2019, Cycling Made Easy was renamed to Energise E-bikes to reflect the life-changing effect the products had on their customers. Today, Energise E-bikes has the widest range of electric bikes of any retailer in the UK from small, folding electric bikes, to Dutch-style stepthrough e-bikes, to full-suspension off-road e-bikes.",
                "What is an electric bike?Imagine going on a bike ride but no matter where you went you had a helpful tailwind pushing you forward. Imagine how much fun that journey would be. Imagine how much quicker you\u2019d arrive somewhere. That\u2019s what an electric bike ride feels like.",
                "Electric bikes (or \u2018e-bikes\u2019) are bicycles with an added motor which boosts your pedal power with lithium battery power. It\u2019s a bit like a microphone for a singer. A singer sings loud, quiet, and everything in between, while the microphone amplifies the power of their sound. An electric bike is similar. The rider pedals hard, pedals soft, and everything in between, while the motor and battery amplifies the power of their pedalling. You can turn up and turn down this electrical assistance to the level that you want.",
                "If you\u2019re riding uphill, you\u2019ll be able to pedal up without putting a dangerous strain on your heart, muscles or joints. If you\u2019ve got a long journey ahead, you can use that extra energy to make sure you get to your destination feeling fresh rather than becoming a sweaty mess. If you\u2019re carrying shopping, the extra energy is there to help you haul the load back home.",
                "Essentially, you\u2019re riding with the power of two people. An e-bike is not, however, a moped. If you want the extra power, you have to pedal. It\u2019s not a free ride but it is certainly a fun ride.",
                "What makes Energise E-bikes different from the competition?I think people are reassured to have experts on their high street. Energise E-bikes is a specialist retailer with a bricks-and-mortar premises where people can test-ride the bikes and ask a human their questions.",
                "We also offer free lifetime servicing which no other bike retailer in the country offers. We know buying an electric bike is a big purchase. We can help people get a long life out of them with free annual maintenance.",
                "Not only that but we practice what we preach. Most of our staff ride an electric bike into work. It keeps us energised and our carbon footprint low. And it means we can advise people from personal experience.",
                "Most bike retailers would stock a couple of electric bikes but every single bike you see in our showroom is an e-bike. In fact our expertise was recognized by the bike industry as a whole when we were nominated for \u2018Best Specialist Retailer\u2019 in 2017 at the BikeBiz Awards and we are also one of only ten places in the country to be listed as a Bosch E-bike Expert.",
                "How did you get into the e-bike industry?The seeds of Energise E-bikes were planted when I was still running a former business. While exploring where my staff commuted from, I found many lived in hilly, traffic-choked areas. I looked at electric bikes, which presented the solution but back then, when e-bikes were simply watered-down mopeds, the quality disappointed me.",
                "However, when I sold my business in 2008, e-bike design and quality had vastly improved. They were lighter, quieter, smoother to ride and they looked great. The market on continental Europe was booming but had no strength here in the UK.",
                "I thought we could be pioneers in the market. So we took the plunge first with a small unit on Chipstead Valley Road in Coulsdon and called ourselves Cycling Made Easy. Now we have a 2,000 square foot showroom on Brighton Road and we\u2019ve rebranded as Energise E-bikes to reflect how our products makes people feel: energised!",
                "What are the benefits of using an e-bike?E-bikes can go where cars aren\u2019t allowed, where walking would take too long, and where a conventional bike would struggle. Most of all, they are incredibly fun to ride. Many people say it feels like the way cycling felt when they were a kid \u2013 a real sense of freedom and possibility.",
                "Most of our customers use their bikes for exercise and leisure, using the extra energy to help them do longer more ambitious rides, so they get to see so much more of the \u2018hidden\u2019 green spaces our country has to offer. For example, did you know that there is a National Nature Reserve here in the south of the borough? It\u2019s perfect e-biking territory. There are so many natural beauty spots like that in this country and sometimes the only way to explore them is on an e-bike.",
                "The customers who commute on their e-bikes are able to get to work without needing to shower on arrival and they can usually guarantee their journey time as well.",
                "Are they expensive to buy/run?E-bikes are a long-term investment but incredibly cheap to run. Per year, we estimate it will be around \u00a35.20 to keep the battery charged. You wouldn\u2019t get much petrol for \u00a35.20 these days! Plus of course Energise E-bikes give you an annual service for free.",
                "If anyone is thinking of buying an e-bike, please, please do not buy one which is similar in price to a conventional one. You will end up buying something which is mechanically compromised.",
                "People do raise an eyebrow when they see a \u00a32000 price tag on our electric bikes, but they truly can replace your petrol-guzzling car, your annual travelcard and gym membership in one fell swoop.",
                "How do you charge them?In the same way as your mobile or laptop. You plug it in at the mains and top it up when you need to. You can take the battery off the bike so if you\u2019ve stopped off at a caf\u00e9 or pub, you can plug that in and get a quick top up.",
                "How fast do they go/can you ride them on pavement/road?E-bikes go as fast as you can pedal them but the motor is active at all speeds between 0 and 15.5mph. That\u2019s the difficult bit for the human body \u2013 going from a stand still to cruising speed. Above 15.5mph, the bike is being powered by your leg power and momentum alone. In reality, you will find yourself cruising along at 12-15mph which is actually faster than the average speed of traffic in towns and cities.",
                "You should ride them on the road if you can. Since an e-bike\u2019s average speed is so much faster than a conventional bike, you will be passed by fewer cars, so it\u2019s a much nicer experience than you might be used to. If you feel like the road is becoming too dangerous when you\u2019re out riding, guidance says you can go on to the pavement, but please go at a \u2018pedestrian-friendly\u2019 speed.",
                "It\u2019s worth noting, that while e-bikes are completely road legal in this country, the increasingly common e-scooter are still actually illegal for public use. E-scooter trials are happening in a few areas, but for most people, e-scooters cannot legally be used in public.",
                "What is the future for the e-bike industry?Very often, someone who test-rides an electric bike with us will end the ride by saying, \u201cThat is the future!\u201d I think with the pandemic, e-bikes are the vehicle for today. They create zero-emissions, they get people exercising, and can help keep people off public transport while the pandemic continues.",
                "There is no doubt that more commuters will switch to e-bikes and away from cars especially if more protected cycle lanes are created. The government has pledged millions to create these so fingers crossed this is done well.",
                "It\u2019s great to see that there are temporary cycle lanes being created and hopefully this will make cycling in general much easier.",

                "East Croydon Cool was set up to showcase all the great things about Croydon. As a community marketing platform (incorporating a website, social media channels, merchandise range, events programme and e-zine) it aims to inform people on what\u2019s going on at local businesses, keep people updated on local events and foster a sense of local pride. During a period of regeneration, it helps forge relationships between Croydoners to ensure the community continues to shine as brightly as its new buildings do.",
                "Never did we imagine that we\u2019d end up discussing a pandemic.",
                "And largely, we won\u2019t be. We\u2019ll leave that to the experts.",
                "But the coming weeks and months will highlight more than ever, the importance of community, culture and creativity. And that IS something we know a bit about.",
                "Whilst Community was traditionally always associated with people living, working and socialising together IRL, the internet changed things. Technology has enabled the strengthening of more obvious community groups and also helped develop virtual communities (by bringing people together not in person, but online via their common interests). A community (whether offline or online) is powerful and countless evidence reminds us we can achieve more collectively than we can individually. In a time when people are feeling out of control, community can provide a sense of support, of belonging and of influence. Croydon has always had a strong sense of community and at East Croydon Cool, we hope to leverage the online community we have built to help local residents, businesses, entrepreneurs and workers in as many ways as possible.",
                "In terms of Culture and Creativity, Croydon is ahead of the curve (we won Borough of Culture 2023 by demonstrating it!). Creativity is going to be a vital skill in these new times; both in terms of dealing with new problems and in keeping sane. People are going to need new types of cultural and creative activities to keep them entertained and we are confident Croydon\u2019s people and organisations will find ways in which to provide it. East Croydon Cool aims to leverage our online community to showcase Croydon\u2019s culture and creativity during this time.",
                "Whilst not wanting to trivialise the seriousness of the medical implications, we know the economic, social and mental health impacts of Coronavirus will also be huge. \u00a0We want to do as much as possible to support local businesses and residents. So in addition to our day-to-day role of promoting what\u2019s going on in the local area, we will also be working on a range of community focused creative projects.",
                "Our current projects are detailed below.",
                "This is new territory, and perhaps not everything we do will help, but we\u2019re going to give as much as we can a try.",

                "Project One: #LocalsLoveLocally campaignThis is a social media campaign, backed by a dedicated page on our website. It encourages Croydon residents to support local businesses during the Coronavirus by highlighting specific ways in which they can help them. A listing on the East Croydon Cool website details the business\u2019s special offers and activations and these are also shared on social media channels using the unique hashtag #LocalsLoveLocally. The campaign essentially offers Croydon businesses the opportunity to promote themselves to a wider audience for free. This campaign is being run in partnership with local community fundraiser,Hannah Sayers, who provides support to communities for projects that improve local heritage, leisure, culture and greenspaces. For more information on this project,CLICK HERE.",
                "Project Two: Self Isolation TipsLocal resident and graphic designer,Georgina Marmoy, has created a series of Self-Isolation templates that people can share to demonstrate how they can help others. We\u2019ve taken herSelf-Isolation Tipstemplate and shared with a few creative locals to get their innovative ideas on what to do when stuck indoors. We are sharing these on ourInsta-Stories(and highlights) so if you\u2019re looking for some indoor inspiration, check these out. Got a tip of your own? Complete the template, share on social and tag us in and we\u2019ll help spread the word.",

The best photos would be featured in the magazine later in the year. For more info,CLICK HERE.",
                "Project Seven: Indoor Plant competition (in partnership with Knttd)With the ongoing press attention about the mental health benefits of having (and looking after!) indoor plants during lockdown, we\u2019ve partnered withKnttd, a handcrafted and eco-friendly knitted planters business based here in Croydon, to ask residents to show us their urban jungles (or beginnings of them!). The competition asks people to share photos on Instagram (using #LockdownPlanter and tagging in@Knttd_London) to win a beautiful knitted planter for one of their plant babies.\u00a0 For more info,CLICK HERE.",
                "Project Eight: Croydon Yoga Hub TakeoverWith Lockdown 3 continuing to take its toll, we\u2019re focusing Valentines weekend on Self-Love and Self-Care and have teamed up withCroydon Yoga Hubto offer a free live yoga session. For more info,CLICK HERE.",
                "Project Nine: Learn how to make the perfect Cup of Coffee (A Mr Tinto Takeover)As the WFH coffee break continues on, we\u2019ve joined forces with specialist coffee roaster, Mr Tinto, to show Croydoners how to make the perfect cup at home. Participants of this free, interactive live takeover will receive a\u00a0 packet of Mr Tinto coffee to use during the 20 minute session which will include\u00a0an introduction to Columbian coffee beans, how to set up a coffee station at home and the different types of brewing. For more info,CLICK HERE.",
                "Project Ten: Table for Six!As lockdown starts to ease, we\u2019re keen to help residents re-connect with other locals (IN REAL LIFE!) again. We also want to show support to the local hospitality venues who have lost out on trade during all of this. So we are arranging a series of \u2018Table for Six\u2019 meet ups \u2013 to bring together a group of six local residents who work in the creative disciplines. These small meet ups are being held in The Store, Basil & Grape and Matthew\u2019s Yard. See the EVENTS page for more details."

Residents were given a time slot, to comply with social distancing guidelines, and invited down to plant something beautiful, making their own contribution to the future of their community. Allowing the people of Thornton Heath to have an active role in this project was pivotal to creating a space they will actually use, a place which is inspiring and encourages creativity.",

So I took a small but vital step in the right direction to bring more green space to the Croydon community. I\u2019m still moved that Timberland would support such a grassroot initiative, and help us link up with London National Park City\u201d.",

                "East Croydon Cool talks\u2026is a blog series that explores topics of cultural interest via local area experts. This month we caught up withSophia Carey, a freelance photographer and designer who grew up in Croydon, to talk about her latest projectHOM[E]AGE.",
                "HOM[E]AGE explores the themes of coming of age and of home; exploring the way that people interact with their environment and how the people and places that they engage with influence their person, their ideologies and their craft. Sophia has started the project in the town she grew up, with HOM[E]AGE Croydon focusing on the towns and places that make up the London Borough of Croydon, and the people that enrich it. It is a homage to the place and the people.",
                "Firstly, how did you get into photography and videography?My initial journey into photography was through studying graphic design and using a camera to capture photographs for my design work. From there, I started to attend music events around London (mostly South) with my camera and build up connections on the hip hop and grime scene.",
                "What was the inspiration behind the HOM[E]AGE project?HOM[E]AGE was initially inspired by a desire to re-write the narrative around Croydon. It\u2019s no secret that the press around Croydon can be particularly negative, but my perception of Croydon \u2013 and especially the people I meet from Croydon \u2013 has starkly contrasted those negative connotations. Some of the most dedicated, hard-working and talented individuals I know have grown up in and around Croydon and I really wanted to create a project that showcased that.",
                "Why did you start in Croydon? What other areas do you plan to capture?I\u2019ve started the project in Croydon because that\u2019s where the initial idea was born. Croydon is a place that I attribute a lot of my growing up and coming of age too and has massively developed me into the person and the creative that I am today. Whilst I live in Manchester now, it was important to me to pay homage to the area that first formed me. Next on the cards for HOM[E]AGE is definitely going to be Manchester; which has been my home for the last three years since I moved here for uni. Croydon and Manchester together really tell the story of my coming of age.",
                "How did you go about choosing the people and places you featured?The places, so far, have just been areas that are important to me. Eventually, once I\u2019ve covered all of those areas, I\u2019ll be location scouting to develop the series further. In terms of the people, for the first series I incorporated a lot of people that I already know, as well as people that I see making positive changes within the community. Really, what I\u2019m looking for is people with qualities that I want to showcase: hard work, dedication, talent, to name but a few.",
                "Did anything surprise you about the process?I wouldn\u2019t say that anything surprised me, per se, but I did learn a lot about things that the people I interviewed had done or were contributing to the community that I wasn\u2019t aware of before. That just really re-affirmed that they were the right choices to showcase in the project.",
                "Was there a common thread to how interviewees felt about their hometown?Overwhelmingly, people were proud to be from Croydon. All of the people I interviewed could recognise how the borough had shaped them or influenced them in their craft, which was really nice to hear.",
                "How has the project been received so far?So far the response has been great. I\u2019ve been working on the project for a long while now, having started it back in 2019, and so it\u2019s really great to see people take to the project so well. I\u2019ve also had a lot more people from the borough get in touch and say they want to be involved, which I\u2019m really excited to make happen as soon as possible.",
                "What\u2019s next for the project\u2026we hear there\u2019s a book in the planning?!There\u2019s a lot planned! We\u2019ve got some more interviews yet to film, which have had to be postponed due to COVID-19, as well as a book on the way! I\u2019m also planning an event, hosted in Croydon, to celebrate the project but that\u2019s also dependent on the current pandemic. I\u2019d definitely say keep your eyes peeled, though!",

Having turned to fitness to escape his daily routine as a teenager, he soon found it built his confidence, strength and improved his health and so went on to pursue a career in fitness. After working for many major gym chains in London for years, Fernando decided to go solo and launched his own fitness company running outdoor fitness bootcamps which he has been doing for over 15 years now. His ability to get people moving so they see real results has enabled him to build a loyal clientele.\u00a0 In these testing times, his journey has now evolved to offer a wide range of fun and relatable live-stream fitness classes. Drawing on his years of experience as a fitness professional, Fernando now puts clients through their paces within the comfort of their own homes. Classes are designed to be accessible for a variety of levels and require minimal equipment (with a focus on using bodyweight, hand weights, kettlebells and resistance bands)."

                "Prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, which has brought many issues across UK society into sharper focus (from the climate emergency to widespread inequality) the design competition was focused on creating housing for a better world.",
                "During lockdown, our homes have become increasingly central to our daily lives. This \u2018Housing for a Better World\u2019 competition was created to seek out bold and thought-provoking ideas for how our homes can improve the urgent issues of health, sustainability and an inequality for residents and wider communities.",
                "The competition set out to find practices with diverse talent, bring forward positive change within the architectural profession and better reflect the diversity of the neighbourhoods in which they work.",
                "Entrants were asked to demonstrate their commitment to diversity through existing staff or planned action as part of the competition process. As Croydon is one of the most diverse boroughs in London, the winning practice needed to field a diverse team and show how they could respond to local issues to best meet the needs of the local community.",
                "The shortlisted teams presented their ideas as part of the Architecture Foundation\u2019s 100 Day Studio programme (available to watch here), with the judging panel tuning in live before meeting virtually to decide the winner.",
                "Yesterday, the winner of competition was announced\u2026",
                "Jas Bhalla Architectswon on the strength of their \u2018Parade Living\u2019 concept, which seeks to improve poor quality housing above linear retail parades by providing alternative models of housing. The Practice\u00a0beat the five other teams to win a commission to design one of the schemes on Brick By Brick\u2019s next small sites programme, which is due to start in the autumn.",
                "The linear shopping parade at the heart of their concept is prevalent across Croydon, with associated housing disproportionately used by minority ethnic groups. These homes rarely meet space standards and are often accessed via undesirable services yards. Through targeted intensification, Parade Living seeks to demonstrate that these locations can provide homes that are generous, flexible and commercially viable.",
                "This concept aligns with Brick By Brick\u2019s ethos of addressing the housing crisis through creating high quality homes on piecemeal infill sites throughout the borough.",
                "The proposals are characterised by dual aspect units designed to work with long and narrow plots. New accommodation will exceed national space standards, providing additional storage and external amenity. Homes are designed to utilise volumetric and/or panelised modular construction to deliver several benefits, including lowering embodied carbon, maintaining high quality and improving viability. Preliminary plans illustrate how offsite manufacturing can be used without creating overly cellurised, deep single aspect units.",
                "The competition represents the first step for Brick By Brick in redefining how consultancy services are procured to ensure that their homes are designed and built by people who are more representative of the wider population in Croydon and London. The initiative is intended to enable the developer to widen its network of designers and start to build relationships with a range of talented practices that have been under-represented in commissioning to date.",
                "Chloe Phelps, Head of Design and Commercial at Brick By Brick / Common Ground Architecture, said:\u201cWe\u2019re really excited to start working with Jas Bhalla Architects. Their competition entry demonstrated an in depth understanding of the challenges facing Croydon in terms of housing quality and high streets, with a clear and intelligent concept. Although we had to name one winner, this process has opened up a new network for us and we will seek opportunities to work with the shortlisted practices in the future. This competition has shown how, with the right process, you can identify talented and exciting practices and architects from all backgrounds. We\u2019ve learnt that by integrating the thinking into the process, the result is a more diverse field \u2013 and we hope the wider industry will start to take this approach.\u201d",
                "Pragga Saha, judge and alumna, Stephen Lawrence Trust, said:\u201cThe competition has been engaging at each stage and choosing a winner was so challenging as the shortlisted entries all had different strengths. Jas Bhalla Architects had a strong clarity of concept and their research was fantastic. I\u2019ve really enjoyed being part of this process, and it is a testament to what can be achieved by community driven and diverse practices when given the chance!\u201d",
                "Jas Bhalla, Principal, Jas Bhalla Architects, said:\u201cWe are really excited to have been selected by Brick By Brick, especially given the rich ideas and extremely high standard of presentations given by all finalists. The competition has been a great opportunity to explore new concepts of collective living and discuss ideas in the context of issues such as viability and delivery, ensuring proposals focus on improving housing for under-represented groups.At the heart of our concept is the idea that if we are serious about tackling race-based inequality, it\u2019s important to develop a nuanced understanding how and why different cultures live a certain way. If we can do this, there\u2019s a huge opportunity to not only deliver much need housing numbers, but also bring material change to some of the most disadvantaged groups across the borough.\u201d",

                "\u201cLaunched in 2017 as an alternative style and culture magazine, ASBO is the voice of frustrated youth world-wide. ASBO brings the underground, overground, from what is happening on the streets of India to the council estates of the UK.\u00a0ASBO is a provocative.\u00a0original, definitive style\u00a0magazine that interacts with its readership on many different levels.\u00a0From the beginning it was a\u00a0cultural trailblazer; covering music, fashion, film,\u00a0TV, society, politics and global current affairs from a fresh youth prospective that is not too frightened to stick it\u2019s two fingers up to society. Championing under-represented, creative, young talent; ASBO has quickly become a bible for those in the know.\u201d",
                "Whilst working from home in joggers and hoodies has been great, we know a lot of you are starting to tire of your \u201clockdown look\u201d. So we\u2019re working with ASBO to encourage Croydoners to open up their wardrobes and show off their Croydon Style.",
                "Post a photo on Insta using #CroydonStyle and tag in @EastCroydonCool and @Asbomagazine and the most stylish looks will be featured in the magazine later in the year.",
                "So if you need an excuse to make a new online purchase, want a reason to dress to impress, are looking for motivation to get creative with the sewing machine or simply need to switch things up between your day and night pyjamas; get involved!",
                "The project will be running until end of June (when we\u2019ll hopefully be able to start dressing up again to go out out and maybe even OUT OUT)."
